# Group3-SE

ShoeBae's primary mission is to offer high-quality footwear at affordable prices, catering specifically to college students. We uphold product integrity through stringent quality assurance measures and thorough character evaluations of potential sellers, fostering trust-based, enduring relationships with our buyers. As part of our commitment to establishing lasting connections, ShoeBae does not support guest checkout, prioritizing the cultivation of long-term buyer relationships.

Our platform promotes transparent communication between sellers and administrators, recognizing its pivotal role in fostering strong business relationships. To ensure inclusivity, ShoeBae is accessible in multiple languages, including Spanish and Turkish, with plans for additional language support. Additionally, our design prioritizes accessibility, featuring dyslexia-friendly settings and accommodations for users with light sensitivity.

Revenue generation for ShoeBae's administration is facilitated through first-time seller fees and transactional charges, reflecting the inherent risks associated with initial business engagements. Advertising fees are contingent upon seller budgets, with ad applications subject to rigorous review processes to safeguard site integrity.

ShoeBae's responsive design ensures seamless user experiences across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Intuitive navigation is facilitated through an integrated FAQ section and site guide, streamlining the browsing and purchasing processes.

Buyers are empowered to provide feedback through seller ratings and reviews, enhancing transparency and accountability within our marketplace. This feedback system safeguards against fraudulent activities and ensures seller authenticity.

While ShoeBae currently specializes in footwear sales, its adaptable infrastructure paves the way for future expansion into apparel and other product categories, reflecting our commitment to continuous growth and innovation.
